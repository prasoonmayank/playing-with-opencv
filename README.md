# Playing with OPENCV

The code base is meant for multiple projects made for fun to understand how different image processing features work in opencv

The features that I have implemented here are:

1. Threshold
2. Blur
3. Edge detection
4. Contours
5. Image arithmetic
6. Image augmentation
7. SIFT
8. SURF
9. BRISK

You can download the images that I have used here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7qupd80oqf5jl1j/AADk-ZwieVcZcbHY3Ghty5e_a?dl=0
